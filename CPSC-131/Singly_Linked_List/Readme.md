Assignment 1: Explain what a singly-linked list is. Why is is this more useful than an Array? What is the downside to using a linked list compared to an Array?

Assignment 2: Explain what a memory-leak is with linked lists. Why do we care about memory leaks? How do we prevent memory leaks from occuring?

Assignment 3: Create the struct for a basic Node. Explain what each variable in that struct are useful for. Create an expanding linked list based on how many inputs the user wanted to put in. Then print out all of the values from the linked list. Then delete the list completely, avoiding memory leaks.

Assignment 4: Warning!! This may cause your Operating System to crash, and you may lose the information of running programs. Do this with caution!!
	      Make a program that will purposely create memory leaks of a singly linked list. Ask the user if they would like to make 1 Gigabyte or half a Gigabyte (500 megabytes) of a memory leak. Based on their input, create a linked list of the following size, and don't delete the list (let it drift off into memory).
	      Look at your task manager and see how your memory is affected by this.


Assignment 5: Create a linked list based on the users input. Allow them to insert the node at any index of the singly linked list. When they are finished, print out the
	      Linked list. Finally, delete all the segments for the linked list.
