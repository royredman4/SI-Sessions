Templates can be useful for multiple reasons.
The main point about it is that you are able to
create a function that will accept any data type
that passes it. For example, if you have a function
thats main purpose is to output a set of variables
or an array of variables, you can use templates
to cover any data type you pass it, and output it
as desired. Since the process of outputting a
string variable is the exact same process as
outputting a double variable, it should be easy
to create one function that is templated to cover
all scenarios, rather than using function overloading
and create multiple functions for every single
scenario and have that function doing exactly the same
thing as all the other overloaded functions.
