Assignment #1: Explain why templates are useful 
in C++. What makes it unique to the C++ programming 
language.

Assignment #2: Create a function that will combine
two variables of the same data types together. Have
the result of the combination outputted in the main
to the user.

Assignment #3: Create a function that will display
a set of information onto the screen, no matter what
data type it is. For this assignment, I used multiple
arrays of information about the housing market crash
and its recovery since the house market crash. All 
this information is random, but can be used to show
how templates are useful for programmers.
