Assignment #1: What is a File stream? How does it
differ compared to an iostream? Does the programming
with cin and cout work similairly like the File streams 
implimentations? Explain why or why not.

Assignment #2: create a program that will keep track of
leftover coins you have to put into your piggybank when
you get home. The program will ask if you got any more spare
change or not to put into the program. If you do, you will
be asked, how many Quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies 
you have as leftover coins. Once you input the program, it
will then exit (no File Storing).

Assignment #3: Following assignment #2, Alter the program
so it will be able to read from a text file called "coins.txt",
read in all the information (including the name of the coin 
type and the amount of coins for that coin type). After it 
has read all from the text file and saved it into memory, 
have that coin information displayed to the screen with 
the total value of the coin values combined. After that, 
Assignment #2's portion should run (asking for leftover 
coins). Once the user is done inputting coins, make sure 
to update the "coins.txt" file with the new coin values, 
so it can be used on the next program run.
