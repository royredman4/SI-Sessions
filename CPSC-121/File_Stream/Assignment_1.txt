File stream allows the programmer to access a text
file and write to a text file overall. The main difference
between it and iostream is that one comes from/goes to the
console, and the file stream comes from/goes to a file. 

This can be extremely usefull since, our data is able to be
stored to a file, or retrieval again when we restart the program
again later, meaning that we can run the program, returning
from where we left off previously. This means that you can 
keep data and keep it updating regularly every time you re-run
the program. This allows you to store useful data over a long
period of time overall.

This is very similair to iostream in terms of its syntax, but is
slightly different. Example:

string value;
ofstream outfile("temp.txt);

outfile << value;
cout << value;

outfile.close();


As you can see here, aside from opening/closing the file, using
the output command is very similair to the two. The only difference
is that for the file variable, you use that name (outfile), instead
of the call "cout". Otherwise, it is the same thing. Same scenario
applies to ifsteam and cin :

string value;
ifstream infile("temp.txt);

infile >> value;
cin >> value;

infile.close();

Aside from the previously mentioned differences, they are very much
the same. Overall, File Streams are extremly useful for long term storage
and constant updating.
