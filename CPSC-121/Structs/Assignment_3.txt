Structs are really useful for being able to categorizing a
set of variables into one data type. For example, a Dog
cannot be only defined by one variable. A Dog have many
pieces of information related to itself. It has a breed
type, a certain color of hair and its daily food intake.
We can combine that into one data type, that we will call
Dog. Here is an example:

struct Dog{
  string breed;
  string hair_color;
  double food_intake;
}

All of these variables are available to manipulate by
creating a single variable that is type Dog, as shown below

Dog myDog;

myDog.breed = "Husky";
myDog.food_intake = 23.3;

you can set all the variables for "myDog" and it will stay
there nicely into each varible. This is why the struct 
can be useful for programming, it holds all the variables
you need into one nicely planned out struct (structure)
