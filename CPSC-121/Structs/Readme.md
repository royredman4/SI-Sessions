all_time favorite professor. The professor has a name, a course they're 
teaching and the textbook they are using for their course. Constuct the 
struct(s) given the following information.


Assignment #2: Using the stuct you created, create an array of Students 
and call it "classroom". There are a maximum of 35 students in a 
classroom. After that, initialize (through cin) the students 
information that are enrolled in the classroom. If you have enough 
time, display all the students information.


Assignment #3: Explain why a struct can be useful. How does it help
programmers achieve what they want to do easier than before.
