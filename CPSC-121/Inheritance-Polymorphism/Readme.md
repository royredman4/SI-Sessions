Assignment #1: Create a base class called "Cars". This base class
will hold the information about how much miles per gallon (MPG) 
the car has, the color of the car, whether or not the car has a
manual transmission, and the size of the tires on the car.

Assignment #2: Continuing from Assignment #1, create a derived class
called "Rv", that inherits the Cars class and contains the Bathroom
count, Seat Count, Bed Count, and whether the Rv has a stove or not.

Assignment #3: After completing all previous assignments, create an object
of each class, and be able to output all the information about them. For 
example: if the object is type "Rv", output all the information based on 
the Rv (including the information from the inherited "Car" class). If you 
outputting from an object of type "Car", output all the information about 
the Car class.

Assignment #4: After completing the previous assignemnts, change the
function print() to a virtual function. From there, create a pointer array 
that can hold both of type Cars and Rv. After that, output the print 
function from both indexes in the array. 

Assignment #5: Explain why Inheritance can be useful in c++. Also, explain
what the difference is between Inheritance and polymorphism
