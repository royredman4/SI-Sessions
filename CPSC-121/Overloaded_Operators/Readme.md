Create a class called "Dog" that stores information
about a dog. The class would keep track of the dogs name, weight, the
cost for the dog, the breed of the dog and their age. In the main, create
and array of type dog and call it "DogShop".


Assignment #1: overload the cout (<<) operator in order to be able to
output the Dogs breed and the age of the dog from the main. Make sure you 
are able to output multiple Dog types in the same cout 
(ex: cout << Dog1 << Dog2 << Dog3;)


Assignment #2: overload the greater/less than (<, >) operator that compares the
cost of each dogs in the main.

Assignment #3: overload the cin (>>) operator so that the dogs information can be
changed. This includes changing all variables associated with the Dog type. Make
sure to check for errors before inputting it into the private members
