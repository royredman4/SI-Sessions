Create a class called "Dog" that stores information
about a dog. The class would keep track of the dogs name,
the breed of the dog, their weight, the cost for
the dog and their age. In the main, create 
an array(size 32) of type dog and call it "DogShop".


Assignment #1: overload the cout (<<) operator in order to be able to
output the Dogs name, its breed and its age, from the main. Make sure you 
are able to output multiple Dog types in the same cout 
(ex: cout << Dog1 << Dog2 << Dog3;)


Assignment #2: overload the greater/less than (<, >) operator that compares the
age of each dogs in the main.

Assignment #3: overload the cin (>>) operator so that the dogs information can be
changed. This includes changing all variables associated with the Dog type. Make
sure to check for errors before inputting it into the private members

Assignment #4: Fill the array with a random set of ages and prices for each dog. Once
they have all been assigned, find a way to organize each dog based
on their age. Organize the dogs from lowest age to the highest age. Once sorted,
reduce the price of every dog that is older than 9 by 40% so they are have a better
chance of being sold in the dogshop.

Assignment #5: Explain why Overloaded operators are useful to have. What makes
them convienient to use than other methods?
