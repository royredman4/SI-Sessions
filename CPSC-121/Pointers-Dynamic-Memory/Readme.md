Assignment #1: Create a reciept calculator that keeps track of the users
reciept values and calculate the total value at the end. Also be able to
create a function that will find the average reciept price of all the reciepts
inputted. Make sure that the reciepts are stored into a dynamic array of type
double. You will identify the exact size of that array by asking them for how
many reciepts they have.



Assignment #2: Do the same as assignment #1, except for one change. Do not ask
the user for the size of the array. You will need to be able to create a system
that will be able to adapt to larger reciept sizes than your original dynamic array
