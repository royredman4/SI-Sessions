Assignment #1: Explain why functions can be useful. Explain the advantages 
of it and how it can be implemented. Explain also the differences in passing 
by value and passing by reference. Explain the details about return statements also. 
Explain the issue of calling the main like any other standard function. Explain what 
happens to the variables/parameters when you exit the function call. Explain the 
differences between global/local/static variables. Explain how default values could be 
created for functions that pass less arguments than there are parameters.

Assignment #2: Create a function that will calculate your monthly paywage based on the 
number of hours you have worked that month, and also how much you get paid on a monthly 
basis. Return the results to the main to be outputted to the user.

Assignment #3: (Extension of assignment #2) Create a second function that will use that 
paywage information and the current tax rate and calculate the actual monthly paywage 
after taxes have been removed from the paycheck. Return the results to the main to be 
outputted to the user.

Assignment #4: Create the previous assignment without using any return statements 
(take some time to think about this) and output the values in the main.

Assignment #5: Create a function that will take a users full name (as parameters). If the 
user does not have a middle name, DO NOT pass that argument to the function. Use a default 
argument to indicate that the user does not have a middle name. In the function, you will 
take their full name and save it as one string. The function will return the string to the 
main and the main will output it to the user.

Assignment #6: Same as Assignment #5, but instead, use function overloading to solve this issue, 
(instead of default arguments)
