Assignment #1: Explain why Arrays are useful for
both programmers and the users that will use our
programs. Is there restrictions on what data type
of an array that we can create? Is there a restriction
on how large it can be?

Assignment #2: You are now hired at Sears as a software
engineer (not really) to develop their new cash register 
systems. Your mission (should you accept it), is to create
a cash register system that can hold up to 200 transactions.
Keep in mind, we are only keeping track of the prices that
the user tells us, and nothing more than that. After that,
allow the user to add as many transactions as they like into
the array (assuming as it isn't more than 200 transactions).

Assignment #3: Continuing from Assignment #2, Create a function
that will take the collection of prices and return the total
of the price to the user.

Assignment #4: Continuing from the previous assignments, allow
the user to access any transaction record that they have previously 
inputted based on the which input number they were looking for 
(ex: find the 4th transaction the user had made and tell them how 
much money was spent for that transaction). The user should also be 
able to see all of the transactions they made at any time also.

Assignment #5: Allow the user to change, or delete any transactions 
they made based on which transaction number they choose.If they deleted 
a transaction, make sure the array is cleanly organized following that 
transaction removal.
