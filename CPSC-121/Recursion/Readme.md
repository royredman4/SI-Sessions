Assignment #1: Create a factorial function that will calculate
the factorial of a number that the user inputs. The factorial will
use recursion to calculate it.


Assignment #2: Create a function that will check if a number
inputted is prime or not. The result will be returned to the
main function.

Assignment #3: Create a function that will check a random string
if it contains a space in the string, if it does, replace it with
a underscore character ("_"). Rember to do this recursively 
(checking one character at a time). Make sure to return the 
altered string back into the main for usage.

Assignment #4:Why is recursion useful in programming?

Assignment #5: Create an array that contains multiple int values
in each array. From there pass it into a recursive function that
will calculate the index in the array and return the total
value of all indexes in the arry back to the main.

Assignment #6: Using the array created from assignment #5, pass
the array into a recursive function that will set each index
in the array to zero.

Assignment #7: Continuing from Assignment #6s recursive function.
When the last index in the array is changed to the value of zero,
output (with cout) the value of the index in the array (from the 
last index to the first index), while the recursive calls is 
falling back into the original function call.
