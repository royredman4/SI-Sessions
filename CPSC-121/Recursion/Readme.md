Assignment #1: Create a factorial function that will calculate
the factorial of a number that the user inputs. The factorial will
use recursion to calculate it.


Assignment #2: Create a function that will check if a number
inputted is prime or not. The result will be returned to the
main function.

Assignment #3: Create a function that will check a random string
if it contains a space in the string, if it does, replace it with
a underscore character ("_"). Rember to do this recursively 
(checking one character at a time). Make sure to return the 
altered string back into the main for usage.

Assignment #4:Why is recursion useful in programming?
