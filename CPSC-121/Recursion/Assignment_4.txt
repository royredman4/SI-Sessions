Recursion is really useful because all of your code is 
cleanly layed out in a simple couple of lines of code
but is done multiple times overall. Usually recursion
involves slightly less code than using a loop. This 
is very similair to something like a for loop, but 
usually tends to be preferred more in the field 
overall.It isn't completely usefull now, but in the 
Data Structures class, you will be using it alot with 
larger structures like a linked-lists and binary trees.
