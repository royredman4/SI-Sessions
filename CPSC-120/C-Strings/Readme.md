Assignment #1: Identify the differences between a C-string and a String. What is unique about them?
What is similair between them?

Assignment #2: Create a C-String of 7 characters (not including the null) that will ask the user to
fill in with a word of their choice. The program will then output the C-String to the user.

Assignment #3 Ask the user to input a word of their choice that is 12 characters long. That word will be
saved into one C-String and outputted to the user to ensure it was saved. The user will be asked to input another
word of 12 characters and have it saved into another C-String. The second C-String will also be outputted
to ensure it was saved. Finally, a third C-String will be created and it will store both C-Strings values, then output
the third C-String for ensuring that it was done properly. Here is an example:

please enter a word (no longer than 12 letters): Cat

The word you entered is: Cat

please enter a  second word (no longer than 12 letters): Dog

The word you entered is: Dog

The combination of your two words is: CatDog
