Assignment #1: Identify the differences between a C-string and a String. What is unique about them?
What is similair between them?



Assignment #2: Create a C-String of 7 characters (not including the null) that will ask the user to
fill in with a word of their choice. The program will then create a second C-string that will make a
copy of the first C-String and output the second C-String to the user.

Assignment #3 Ask the user to input a word of their choice (no longer than 12 letters). That word will be
saved into one C-String and outputted to the user to ensure it was saved. The user will be asked to input another
word (no longer than 12 letters) and have it saved into another C-String. The second C-String will also be outputted
to ensure it was saved. Finally, a third C-String will be created and it will store both C-Strings values, then output
the third C-String for ensuring that it was done properly. Here is an example:


please enter a word (no longer than 12 letters): Cat
The word you entered is: Cat
please enter a  second word (no longer than 12 letters): Dog
The word you entered is: Dog
The combination of your two words is: CatDog
