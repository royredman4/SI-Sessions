Assignment #1: Explain why functions can be useful. Explain the advantages of it and
how it can be implemented. Explain also the differences in passing by value and passing
by reference. Explain the details about return statements also. Explain the issue of calling
the main like any other standard function. Explain what happens to the variables/parameters
when you exit the function call. Explain the differences between global/local/static variables


Assignment #2: Create a function that will calculate your monthly paywage based on the
number of hours you have worked that month, and also how much you get paid on a monthly
basis. Return the results to the main to be outputted to the user.


Assignment #3: (Extension of assignment #2) Create a second function that will use that
paywage information and the current tax rate and calculate the actual monthly paywage
after taxes have been removed from the paycheck. Return the results to the main to be
outputted to the user.


Assignment #4: Create the previous assignment without using any return statements
(take some time to think about this) and output the values in the main.
