Assignment 1: Use the Arithmetic Operators to make an calculator for every operation.
Ask for the users numbers that they want to add/subtract/divide/multiply/modulo and then
output the results of that operation.


Assignment 2: Use the Order of operations to program the following math equations:

e = mc^2            //mass-energy equivalence theory
a^2 + b^2 = c^2    //pythagorean theorem
y = mx + b         //slope intercept form
a = 1/2* b *h      //area of a triangle
2x^2 - 4 / x-1    //Randomly created for added complexity
